gCaliper
========

gCaliper is a screen caliper to measure pixel distances, even with arbitrary rotation. The theme is customizable. It requieres Mono and GtkSharp and runs on Linux, Mac and Windows.

If you have any suggestions, please let me know.

In the moment i'm looking for help to create a DEB and RPM package.
