gCaliper is a screen caliper to measure pixel distances, even with variable rotation. The theme is customizable. It requieres Mono / NET 4.0 and GtkSharp 2 and runs on Linux, Mac and Windows.

If you have any suggestions, please let me know.

In the moment i'm looking for help to create a DEB and RPM package.
